# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?
My R squared value coefficient for my model is 0.86. This means that the model is pretty accurate as there is a strong correlation.
2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?
Somewhat yes since some predicted values are pretty close to the actual value but some are extremely far such as Actual: 2500 and Estimated: -1225.53
3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?
For the first it would predict it is worth 8,140.76. For the second car it would predict -557.94.
4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening?
