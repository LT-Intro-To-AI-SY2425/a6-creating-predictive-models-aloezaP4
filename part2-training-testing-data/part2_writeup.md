# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
This model is able to test the line of best fit by splitting the data into training data and test data.

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
It tells you how strongly correlated the data is to the best fit line. This data not having such a strong correlation with an R squared value of :0.684022733024427.

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
I would say it is somewhat accurate as some predictions are close to the actual y value but there is one value that is really far with being off by nearly 25. Therefore, I wouldn't solely rely on this model but it can give an overall estimate.
