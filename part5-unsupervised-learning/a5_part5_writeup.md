## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.
High/High: Make a lot of money and spend a lot of money
High/Low: Make a lot of money but spend little
Average: Make average amount and spend average amounts
Low/High: Make low amounts of money but spend a lot
Low/Low: Make low amounts of money and don't spend a lot.
2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?
High/Low sincethey make decent money and have the ability to shop more but they don't.
3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?
For high/high they would be able to sell them almost anything as they have the income to buy it and also because they choose to buy a lot. I would market something that seems very expensive or fancy since I would assume they like things that are luxurious.
